function window = fn_gaussian(number_of_points, peak_pos_fract, half_width_fract, varargin);
%SUMMARY
%   Creates a gaussian window in a column vector with controlled peak position and width
%USAGE
%	window = fn_gaussian(number_of_points, peak_pos_fract, half_width_fract [, db_down, force_zero])
%AUTHOR
%	Paul Wilcox (2003)
%OUTPUTS
%	window - the generated window function, with amplitude ranging from 0 to 1
%INPUTS
%	number_of_points - how many points are in the window vector
%	peak_pos_fract - whereabouts the peak of the window is as a fraction
%	of the total length of the window vector
%	half_width_fract - how wide the halfwidth of the window is as a fraction of
%	the total length of the window vector
%	db_down[40] - number of dB below peak of window used to define the width.
%	force_zero[0] - if true, points in window outside defined width are
%	set to zero
%NOTES
%	output is a column vector
